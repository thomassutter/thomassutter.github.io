Work experience
======
* 2023 - : PostDoc
  * ETH Zurich: I lead research projects in Prof. Dr. Julia Vogt's lab at ETH Zurich (topics: multimodal learning, generative models) 
  * UC Irvine: I visited Prof. Dr. Stephan Mandt and his group in the fall of 2023 for a research stay.
* 2014-2015: R&D Software Engineer
  * upicto GmbH
  * The project was a contract by MeteoSchweiz to further improve the algorithm developed during my master thesis and productize the findings. I worked on improving the algorithm to estimate the visibility based on images, developing a rendering pipeline using openGL, programming a GUI and designing an image preprocessing pipeline to decide if an image is suitable for visibility estimation.

* 2015-2018: R&D Software Engineer
  * Logitech
  * Consumer Video Unit: I have been mainly working for Logitechâ€™s consumer video unit on developing and improving computer vision algorithms. The work includes various subtasks in a video analytics pipeline which involves motion estimation, as well as appearance based classification and detection methods and testing the developed methods.
