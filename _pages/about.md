I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Medical Data Science group at ETH Zurich, where I work on multimodal machine learning for healthcare applications, improving self-supervised pretraining objectives, combining representation learning methods and generative models, and the differentiability of discrete algorithms and distributions.
Before starting my PhD at ETH Zurich, I worked at Logitech as a software engineer in the consumer video unit and for upicto, a Zurich based start up where I worked on camera based visibility estimation in collaboration with MeteoSwiss.
